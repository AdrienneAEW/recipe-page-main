## Overview
A simple recipe page challenge coded using only the basics. No frameworks like flexbox or grid were used in the project as my focus was on reviewing the basics of HTML and CSS on their own terms. Throughout this journey I've really wanted to get more acquainted with the foundation of coding which to me are HTML, CSS and Javascript. I'm almost sad that this is the final beginner's challenges on Frontend Mentor. I've learned a lot, like there is font-variant property for list markers -  who knew (okay everyone but me) and even got a chance to work with some of new CSS features (if that what's you call these updates). If nothing else, my love of coding has been reignited. Thanks Frontend Mentor.

## My process
My process was to stick with the basic, see if I could position elements without using a framework. And of course getting as close the orignal design as possible without have specs. I'm happy with the results.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass

### What I learned

That HTML, CSS and Javascript are quite powerful and understanding them and staying abreast of updates is crucial to become an expert coder.

### Continued development

I've been reassessing all the Frontend Mentor beginner projects and will choose one to redesign with more advanced features to include in my actual portfolio. So far I think this recipe page is a good candidate for a web app that allows users to enter their own recipes and save, print and share (electronically) with others.

### Useful resources

Mostly I studied practiced different CSS properties using the following documentation:

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - A fantastic open source learning site. It is much more indept then the resource below (W3School) and a resources I continually use to help me understanding and learn how to code properly.
- [WSchool](https://www.w3schools.com/) - A wonderful open source tutorial site that you can practice on, take test, building a website and practice coding. It's where I first started to learn how to code and still one of my favorite resources for learning.
